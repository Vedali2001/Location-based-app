 I chose React.js for building the frontend of the application due to its component-based architecture and ease of use.
- I used React Router for handling navigation between different screens in the application.
- For managing state, I utilized React hooks such as useState and useEffect.
- Challenges Faced:
- One challenge I faced was implementing form validation on the login screen. I addressed this by using useState hooks to manage form state and adding conditional rendering based on validation rules.               - Another challenge was integrating the Mapbox GL library and displaying predefined markers. I solved this by following the documentation and experimenting with different configurations.
